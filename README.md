This repository contains a tool for finding minimal energy configurations for certain toy model amino acid chains, created as a project work in a computational physics course. simulator.py contains the actual optimization tool based on simulated annealing with the Metropolis algorithm, while analysis.py calculates some example results using the tool. The model is based on the article "Toy model for protein folding" (Frank H. Stillinger, Teresa Head-Gordon, and Catherine L. Hirshfeld, 1993), the main difference being that here it's three-dimensional instead of two-dimensional.
